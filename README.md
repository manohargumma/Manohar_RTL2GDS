# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program VSD

The VSD RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout is a hands-on, open-source training program where participants:

Design a RISC-V based System-on-Chip (SoC) starting from RTL.

Use SkyWater 130nm PDK and OpenLane/OpenROAD for physical design.

Generate a final GDSII layout that is actually sent for fabrication (tapeout).
"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem."

## üìÖ Weekly Progress

| Week | Topics Covered | Highlights |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Week 0** | Environment Setup | Installed OpenLane, Sky130 PDK, and verified toolchain on Ubuntu. |
| **Week 1** | RTL Design | Designed a basic 4-bit ALU in Verilog and created testbenches. |
| **Week 2** | Synthesis | Performed synthesis with Yosys, analyzed timing and area reports. |
| **Week 3** | Floorplanning & Placement | Defined core area, placed standard cells. |
| **Week 4** | Routing & GDS Export | Completed routing, checked DRC, and generated final GDSII. |
